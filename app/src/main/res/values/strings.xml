    <string name="kenpo1"> American Kenpo is a martial art characterized
        by the use of quick and powerful strikes delivered from all of the body\'s natural weapons, powered
        by rapid stance transitions. </string>
    <string name="kenpo3">American Kenpo emphasizes lightning fast techniques to destroy an attacker in seconds.
        Kicks are less common, and usually directed at the lower body because high kicks are slower to execute and
        potentially compromise the practitioner\'s balance, higher kicks are taught to more advanced and capable
        practitioners </string>
